# How to play

First, find a friend. Launch missiles at each other by holding a finger on the screen until it charges up. Then lift your finger to release it. You can charge three missiles simultaneously. Each player's base can take exactly 10 hits before being destroyed.

I only tested the game on my Nexus 7 so, no promises it'll work on your device.
